# dicee-dice-roll-app
A simple Android app to simulate a random dice roll


This is my first app for Android that simplly simulates the random roll of 2 die. 
The app is specifically for Android devices only and can be used on any size screen; landscape or portrait mode.
You can clone or download the app to get all the code and images.


The app os very simple: once opened all the user needs to do is click the roll buttonand the 2 dice images will randomlly generate a new roll. 
The code incorporates my first lessons in managing drawable files (storing them and retrieving them), how to set, imageviews, and set a click listener on a button
